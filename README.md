# PHP-Site-Example
One of the firsts sites I made for a client and one of the first times I used PHP in a live build. <br> <br>
_scripts/font-tooltip.js was also one of the first jQuery scripts I wrote to change the font size when the buttons are clicked in the footer <br> <br>
Launched early 2015 and discontinued late 2016, live @ <a href="https://kevinullyott.com/palmerin" target="_blank">https://kevinullyott.com/palmerin</a>
